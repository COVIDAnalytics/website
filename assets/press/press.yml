  text: "The model does show recovery rates, yet in an alarming reveal, about 2-percent of the U.S. population may fall fatally ill from the disease. Bertsimas said, “To put this number into context the whole Vietnam War lost about 50-thousand people, we will lose around 70-thousand that’s more than 40-percent higher than the Vietnam War... This is nothing to laugh about.”"

  text: "The group is building a mortality and disease progression calculator to predict whether someone has the virus, and whether they need hospitalization or even more intensive care. So far, Bertsimas says, advice for COVID-19 patients is “at best based on age, and perhaps some symptoms.”
  By probing the severity of the disease in a patient, he says, “it can actually guide the advice in a much better way.”"
