  text: "The model does show recovery rates, yet in an alarming reveal, about 2-percent of the U.S. population may fall fatally ill from the disease. Bertsimas said, \"To put this number into context the whole Vietnam War lost about 50-thousand people, we will lose around 70-thousand that’s more than 40-percent higher than the Vietnam War... This is nothing to laugh about.\""

  By probing the severity of the disease in a patient, he says, \"it can actually guide the advice in a much better way.\""
