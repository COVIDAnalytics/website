                        For severe COVID-19 patients, medical ventilators can spell the\
                         difference between life and death. These devices are increasingly\
                          in demand, with some US states already experiencing shortages. \

                          another, creating opportunities to mitigate shortages by pooling some of \
                          the ventilator supply across states. Details on data and models can be found in the\
                 [technical report](/ventilator_documentation_pdf), and our source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/COVIDAnalytics/ventilator-allocation).'''),
